		<h1 class="content"> What are our understandings about ICT?</h1>
		<p class="content">Good day, My group and I learned a lot about the lesson being stated in ICT, Our subject is all about HTML and CSS. At first it was very complicated for each and everyone but we manage to understand due to so many practices on how to expertly make a website, we also learned how to save html's and the purposes of its parts. Constructing website is complicated but my group and I manage to come this far ahead. My groupmates and I shared every underestandings we know about this particular topic but ill only state a few understandings, we know that are really important in creating a website using HTML and CSS. In creating a website you should know carefully what code to type in and what are their puposes. Every code has different purposes and you should know about what those purposes are like the closing and opening tags, you should know what their functions are because if not the html may lead to some errors and the codes you worked hard to type in and processed will all come to a waste. There are also so many step by step procedures you have to follow in creating a website, like by simply starting your html with <!DOCTYPE html> this particular code cant go missing. We also learned that it also requires patience,  due to there are so many thing to look on and type into before finishing the whole process of making the document; in addition, we also learned the the importance of CSS. Cascading style sheets is one of the key elements to attract people to visit a site presentation. Such as color, emphasis, and background graphic on some text, makes content more easier and presentable on the eyes of the reader.In HTML we learned how to structure content on web pages using elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and many more.This provides us with practical experience in applying the skills we have learned. We also learned a lot of things about the lessons taught to us in ICT that we need to be responsible and always think before we click because every move can affect our life. We learned on how we should be on the internet,the law's against the cyber crime, the start of social networking site and how technologies evolved and affected our daily lives throughout the years. This is what we have learned so far. </p>
